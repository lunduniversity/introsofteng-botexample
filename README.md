Supplementary teaching material for "Introduction to Software Engineering" at Lund University, LTH. http://cs.lth.se/etsa03/

This repository contains the source code needed to complete the ETSA03 lab exercises, i.e., implementing Basic Melee Bot (BMB). The repository contains all dependencies to allow further evolution into the course project. Furthermore, the repository contains three branches:

- master: All source code needed to get started with Lab 2. This branch should be the only the students need as it should evolve during the Labs.
- before-lab3: Contains an example solution for Lab 2, thus can act as a starting point for Lab 3.
- before-lab4: Contains example solutions for Labs 2 and 3, thus can act as a starting point for Lab 4 and the projects.

This repository can act as a good starting point for the projects. The functionality of BMB will be implemented during Lab 2 and Lab 3. The project also includes Basic Leader Bot (BLB) and Basic Droid (BD). These bots can support testing activities in the projects.
